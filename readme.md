## Main Pages

### Digital Clock
Shows the time, date and a message to the user based on the current time using if statements.

### Weather App
Using async await after a fetch that includes a response.json to take api data , with my unique api key and make it something that can be manipulated to show the weather in Shrewsbury. Which also updates on the page. 
### Password Generator
Uses math.random to create a random number and then math.floor to round down into the lowest full number (so 0.999 would become 0) then times that number by the length of characters that a user can choose. Plus shuffle and for loop to create a uniquely generated password eachtime including symbols, uppercase, lowercase and numbers 0-9.

### Interesting Links
 Allows the user to save links with a title and URL having used methods including createElement, appendChild and addEventListener


### Random Background Images
- All pages use random background images thanks to Math. document. and setInterval
